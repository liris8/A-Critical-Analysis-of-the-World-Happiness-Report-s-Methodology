# A Critical Analysis of the World Happiness Report's Methodology

In this repository, we analyze the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/)'s methodology. This analysis is a deep dive into the intricacies of the variables used in the report, evaluating their interdependencies and relevance. We question the robustness of the data and the measures used to quantify national happiness, highlighting areas of potential redundancy and limitations in current metrics. Our goal is to provide a nuanced critique and suggest improvements for future iterations of the report to better capture the multifaceted nature of happiness.
